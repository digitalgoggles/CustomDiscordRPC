## What Is This?

**Discord Rich Presence (RPC)** allows apps to display detailed info under your name in Discord — like what you're doing, when you started, and even custom text.

This tool gives you a graphical way to change that info:
- The **top and bottom fields** are your **Rich Presence description lines**
  - For example:
    - Top: _"Modding Skyrim ✨"_
    - Bottom: _"In Visual Studio Code"_  
- The app updates Discord live when you press **Submit**.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- macOS (also works on Windows/Linux)
- Discord **desktop app** must be running
- Install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install PyQt5 pypresence

## How to use

- Go to [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications/)
- Click on 'New Application'
- Enter a name **the name you pick will be what appears on your profile**
- Copy the 'Application ID'
- Put it in the tool

And now as long as you have the tool open, you will have a custom rich presence on your discord profile!
